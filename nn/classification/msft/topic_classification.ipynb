I wanted to kick off this week by shopping at some of my favorite thrift stores. And furthermore, styling those thrifted home decor finds to hopefully inspire you with home decor pieces you may already have OR what you could be looking for in your own thrift shopping experience. Buying brand new might be \"easier\" than thrifting home decor, but for me, that totally takes the fun out of making my space feeling curated and special. If nothing else, I hope this video provides you with a general outline of things you might want to look out for the next time you go thrifting and shop sustainably! I hope you all enjoy!

I was fully ready to purchase each one of these inspiration home decor pieces for our new house. BUT with a little bit of money and patience I was able to create items that not only resemble some of these items but for A LOT less money! In this video, you will see how I transformed 4 of these thrift store finds into beautiful home decor pieces that I love for a FRACTION of the cost. These items are some of my favorite thrift flip DIYs to date! But my favorite kind of thrift flip is to not only alter the piece aesthetically but to give it a completely new life and purpose from what it was initially. Make sure you let me know in the comments which one inspired you and don't forget to tag me on IG if you happen to recreate any of these projects.

I wanted to kick off this week by shopping at some of my favorite thrift stores. And furthermore, styling those thrifted home decor finds to hopefully inspire you with home decor pieces you may already have OR what you could be looking for in your own thrift shopping experience. Buying brand new might be \"easier\" than thrifting home decor, but for me, that totally takes the fun out of making my space feeling curated and special. If nothing else, I hope this video provides you with a general outline of things you might want to look out for the next time you go thrifting and shop sustainably! I hope you all enjoy!

I was fully ready to purchase each one of these inspiration home decor pieces for our new house. BUT with a little bit of money and patience I was able to create items that not only resemble some of these items but for A LOT less money! In this video, you will see how I transformed 4 of these thrift store finds into beautiful home decor pieces that I love for a FRACTION of the cost. These items are some of my favorite thrift flip DIYs to date! But my favorite kind of thrift flip is to not only alter the piece aesthetically but to give it a completely new life and purpose from what it was initially. Make sure you let me know in the comments which one inspired you and don't forget to tag me on IG if you happen to recreate any of these projects. Thank you all for your amazing support and positivity!
